    <p>With over 10 years of experience, I have worked as a financial accountant for a variety of industries, including creative industries and hospitality, as well as a financial consultant and mentor. Eager to keep learning and developing my skills, I am currently enrolled on a certificate course in Accounting and Finance at AAT.  I am a budget management, controller and accountability expert with elevated communication skills, a problem solver and a team play. I am looking for an opportunity to combine those skills to support businesses to keep accounts up to date and with good financial practices and compliance.</p>
